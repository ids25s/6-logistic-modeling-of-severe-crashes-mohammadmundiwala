# NYC Crash severity modeling
Using the cleaned NYC crash data, merged with zipcode level
information, we will try to predict the severity of a crash. 

## Train-test Split
Randomly select 20% of the crashes as testing data and leave the rest 80% as training data.
## Fitting a logistic model
### Visualizing results
Explain the confusion matrix result from the testing data. Compute the F1 score.
## Fitting a logistic model with $L_1$ regularization
Select the tuning parameter with 5-fold cross-validation in F1 score
## Comparing two models
Compare the performance of the two logistic models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
